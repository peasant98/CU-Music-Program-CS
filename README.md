# CU Music Program: C++

The program where the eventual goal is to create great music composed by a machine.

This console application implements the <b>Beep</b> function in C++ to randomly generate 'music' with a motif and a user-provided key signature.
With a motif, it is randomly generated but repeated in variations to lower some of the 'randomness' with a consistent yet random motif.

There's also functionality for listening to all 12 major and minor scales as well.
