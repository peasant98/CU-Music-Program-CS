# CU-Music-Program-CS
The program where the eventual goal is to create truly great music composed by a machine.

This console application implements the <b>Beep function</b> in C++ to randomly generate 'music' with a motif and a user-provided key signature.
With a motif, it is randomly generated but repeated in variations to lower some of the 'randomness' with a consistent yet random motif.
